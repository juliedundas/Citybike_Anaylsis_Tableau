My Analysis:

I used Tabluea to create a visual representation of various data regarding the CitiBike program in New York City. The first portion of the Tableau workbook focuses map data to determine trends. I created a street map of the data with a population census layer to see where the most popular stations are during   the most recent month of data  (Feb  2020).  According to the analysis, the most popular CitiBike station for both starting and ending trips is the station called Pershing Square North. Somers St and Broadway was the least popular starting station and Columbus Dr  at Exhange Place  is the least popular  ending  station. It also  appears that females tend to have longer trip durations at 816.76 seconds whereas males have quicker trips lasting 717.85 seconds on average.

The second  part of the workbook analyzes various data based on the year. The first graph shows the average number of miles traveled per day per year. 2017 had the highest average of miles traveled per day at 140,362 average miles traveled per day. The next graph shows the growth of annual memberships over the years, with  the  number of cumulative members in 2013 starting  around 85,000 and in 2019 ending around 300,000. The average trips taken per day hit its peak in 2018 with an average of 62,710 trips  taken per day in NYC. Lastly, the average number of 24-hour passes continues to increase each year, and in 2019 the average number of 24-hour passes sold per day was 5,155 passes. 

Thanks  to  the visualization tools in Tableau, I was able to create several interactive charts and graphs  to help us understand different CitiBike trends.
